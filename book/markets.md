##Markets
I find that we use markets to decide on a map of the world. If one person were
to set the prices for everything, the prices would reflect the persons extimate
of that thing's value. This estimate is individual and is influenced by the
persons subjective situation and perception.

A real market has two differences:
- There are many people deciding the prices, by making trades.
- Resources are limited, and unevenly destributed.

###Trades
Each market trades, by definition, two specific resources. The market allows us
to use the evaluations of all market shareholders as an estimate for the ratio
of value between the two traded resources.

Individual trades are unique and show the subjective estimate value ratio of
the two resources.

###Currency
Multiple markets can share the same resouce and use it to trade between the
markets. This makes it possible to put many different resources into relation.

###Specifications
By analyzing the specific resources which are traded, the causal relationships
of properties and value can be extracted. As the exchange grows, people will
increasingly trade based on formal specifications, instead of real examination.

###Trust
People need to have trust in the exchange to participate in it. They need to be
convinced that they are recieving what was specified.

Markets are places to trade items, and interestingly, the emerging price is the
aggregate estimate of two things' value ratio
